# Clear Creek County Colorado - Tax Lien Redemption & Treasurer's Deed Process (2025)

## Step A: Confirm Lien Ownership / Request Certificate Documentation from County

**Contact Clear Creek County Treasurer's Office**  
📍 405 Argentine Street, Georgetown, CO 80444  
📞 (303) 679-2353  
🌐 [clearcreekcounty.us](https://www.clearcreekcounty.us/193/Treasurer-Public-Trustee)

**Ask the Treasurer:**  
- Whether a certificate of purchase was issued or mailed (and when / to what address).  
- Whether they can issue a duplicate or certified copy of the certificate.  
- What their internal records show for your name, address, and certificate number.  
- Whether they have an endorsement list showing active liens (post-August 1 endorsements).  
- What is the redemption status of the parcel (redeemed or still active).  

If your lien was bought via Zeus Auction, assemble your purchase record and receipts as supporting evidence.

## Step B: Determine Eligibility for Treasurer's Deed (3-Year Rule)

**Redemption Period:** 3 years from lien sale date.  
If not redeemed after 3 years, you may apply for a **Public Auction of a Certificate of Option for Treasurer's Deed**.

Confirm with the county that:  
- The lien has not been redeemed.  
- The redemption period has expired.  

Owners can still redeem **until** the Treasurer's Deed process is finalized.

## Step E: Understanding Non-Marketable Deeds & Quiet Title

**🧾 Why Treasurer's Deeds are "Non-Marketable"**

A Treasurer's Deed gives you legal ownership but not clear (insurable) title right away.

- **Marketable title** means you can sell it, refinance it, or get title insurance easily
- **Non-marketable** means there may still be clouds on the title - other people could later challenge ownership (e.g., heirs, prior mortgagees, unknown owners who claim they didn't get proper notice)

**Why this happens in Colorado:**

The Treasurer's Deed process is administrative, not judicial. The county treasurer issues the deed after notices and waiting periods - but no court formally "clears" competing claims.

Under Colorado law, people who might have lost rights (e.g., prior owners) typically have up to 7 years to challenge the deed (C.R.S. §38-41-108, "limitations to recover lands sold for taxes").

**How investors fix this:**

**Option 1 - Wait it out**
- Hold the property for 7 years
- After that, Colorado's statute of limitations generally bars challenges to your deed (except in rare cases like fraud)

**Option 2 - File a quiet title action**
- A court proceeding asking a judge to confirm your ownership and eliminate other claims
- Costs vary ($2,500-$5,000+ depending on attorney and complexity)
- Once the court grants judgment, your title is fully marketable and insurable right away
- Many investors do this before reselling or developing the property
